# minimal.css

Minimal is an incredibly simple and intuitive tool to design websites and make your sites look gorgeous. The whole idea of this site is to design around and absolutely brilliant typeface, Helvetica Neue. Not only that, but make it super light, `font-weight: 200`. The next step is color, it makes things more precise, and adds organization. Its all about minimalism.
